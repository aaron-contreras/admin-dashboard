# Admin Dashboard 👨‍💼🧑‍💼

Project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to practice CSS grid skills.

## Things I improved on during this project

- CSS Grid. Coming from a pure flexbox mindset (mostly because up to this point I had not dived into Grid as much), I have a much greater appreciation for Grid and can see now when one will more effectively solve my design idea and when to mix them both.
- HTML semantics.
- Working with SVGs and IMGs
- A lot of Emmet shortcuts
